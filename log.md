# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Building A Quiz lesson in freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: CSS can do a lot of interesting things, and I need to learn more about media-queries

Excited to do more tomorrow, and I might even keep going today depending on how the conference goes. I'm really enjoying the new lesson style of freeCodeCamp, and can't wait for the rest of the curriculum to be updated!
