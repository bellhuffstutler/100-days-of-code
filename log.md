# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built A Website Replicating the MMPR fighting game Character Section screen

**Thoughts**: There has to be a better way to code that JS lmao there's no way the most efficient method is to just manually turn all the other ones off for each if statement, but I'll learn that later I'm sure

Can't wait to write more terrible code until eventually it becomes much nicer code lmao

### Day 2: June 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built A Website with a functioning Podoromo Timer and Basic random project Idea List

**Thoughts**: This one took a lot less time, but it felt like I needed more detailed information throughout. I really enjoyed breaking the issue down into more managable chunks, and was super estatic when the site sections functioned as they were supposed to. I know I want to retouch this one later, and make the generator better and potentially allow adding new ideas to the list through the site.

I'm really enjoying working on these, I should have been forcing myself to do projects during downtime more often, I'm learning so much and I am having to look stuff up less often it's super rad!
