# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built A Website Replicating the MMPR fighting game Character Section screen

**Thoughts**: There has to be a better way to code that JS lmao there's no way the most efficient method is to just manually turn all the other ones off for each if statement, but I'll learn that later I'm sure

**Link to work**: [Live](https://codepen.io/bellhuffstutler/pen/qBxJreV) - [Source](https://github.com/bellhuffstutler/Projects/tree/main/Power%20Rangers%20Fighting%20Game%20Character%20Select)

Can't wait to write more terrible code until eventually it becomes much nicer code lmao
