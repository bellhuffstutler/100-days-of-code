# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Building A Quiz lesson in freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: CSS can do a lot of interesting things, and I need to learn more about media-queries

Excited to do more tomorrow, and I might even keep going today depending on how the conference goes. I'm really enjoying the new lesson style of freeCodeCamp, and can't wait for the rest of the curriculum to be updated!

### Day 2: May 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Went through the first 10 lessons in the Scientific Computing with Python course; Finished the Building A Balance Sheet lesson in the Responsive Web design cert!

**Thoughts**: I really like how Python is formatted, and the code is much friendlier to my brain when I don't have to worry about declaring like 4 things for every object and value; Psuedo-selectors in CSS are *super* useful, and setting up websites to be both, more useful for screen readers and legible is a lot haha. seems like a lot of it can be templated though, so that's pretty handy if you set your code up right

Going to take a break to get some coffee and rest my brain, and then finish up the Balance Sheet section of the Responsive Web Design Cert; Finished the Balance Sheet section, remind me that I really don't want to design a bunch of tables in my life that's so tedious lmao

### Day 3: May 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Picasso Painting, Piano, Technical Documentation Page, and City Skyline projects in freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Oh god theres so much you can do with CSS it's wild. Really have to continue to pay a lot of attention to how I input things to avoid typos, but all around today was a really good lesson and in general I'm feeling good about everything.
